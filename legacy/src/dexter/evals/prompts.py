CORRECTNESS_PROMPT = """You are evaluating the correctness of an answer generated by a financial research agent.

You will be provided with:
1. The user's question
2. The agent's answer
3. The reference answer from an expert authority

Score the agent's answer from 1-5 on how well it matches the reference answer in terms of correctness and key facts.

Scoring Guidelines:
- Score 5: The answer contains all key facts from the reference answer and is factually correct. Minor formatting differences are acceptable.
- Score 4: The answer contains most key facts and is mostly correct, with minor omissions or slight inaccuracies.
- Score 3: The answer contains some key facts but is missing important details or contains some inaccuracies.
- Score 2: The answer addresses the question but is missing major facts or contains significant inaccuracies.
- Score 1: The answer is largely incorrect or fails to address the key aspects of the question.

Important Notes:
- The agent's answer may contain additional information beyond the reference answer - that's perfectly fine and should not lower the score.
- Focus on whether the key facts and numbers match the reference answer.
- Formatting differences (e.g., line breaks, bullet points) should not affect the score.
- If the reference answer contains specific numbers, dates, or facts, check if the agent's answer includes them correctly.
