# Dexter ðŸ¤–

Dexter is an autonomous financial research agent that thinks, plans, and learns as it works. It performs analysis using task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data. Think Claude Code, but built specifically for financial research.

## Overview

Dexter takes complex financial questions and turns them into clear, step-by-step research plans. It runs those tasks using live market data, checks its own work, and refines the results until it has a confident, data-backed answer.  

Itâ€™s not just another chatbot.  Itâ€™s an agent that plans ahead, verifies its progress, and keeps iterating until the job is done.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather financial data
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements
- **Schwab Brokerage Integration**: Connect your Schwab account to view positions, get quotes, and place trades
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- OpenAI API key
- Financial Datasets API key (get one at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/dexter.git
cd dexter
```

2. Install dependencies with uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key

# Optional: Add Schwab credentials for brokerage account access
# SCHWAB_USERNAME=your-schwab-username
# SCHWAB_PASSWORD=your-schwab-password
# SCHWAB_TOTP=your-schwab-totp-secret
```

### Usage

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
uv run dexter-agent
```

### Example Queries

Try asking Dexter questions like:

**Financial Statement Analysis:**
- "What was Apple's revenue growth over the last 4 quarters?"
- "Compare Microsoft and Google's operating margins for 2023"
- "Analyze Tesla's cash flow trends over the past year"
- "What is Amazon's debt-to-equity ratio based on recent financials?"

**Schwab Brokerage (requires Schwab credentials):**
- "Show me all my Schwab accounts"
- "What positions do I hold in my Schwab account?"
- "Get me a quote for AAPL"
- "What's the current price of Tesla stock?"

Dexter will automatically:
1. Break down your question into research tasks
2. Fetch the necessary financial data
3. Perform calculations and analysis
4. Provide a comprehensive, data-rich answer

## Architecture

Dexter uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:

- **Planning Agent**: Analyzes queries and creates structured task lists
- **Action Agent**: Selects appropriate tools and executes research steps
- **Validation Agent**: Verifies task completion and data sufficiency
- **Answer Agent**: Synthesizes findings into comprehensive responses
