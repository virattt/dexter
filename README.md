## Overview

Dexter breaks down complex financial queries into actionable tasks, executes them intelligently using real-time data APIs and trading platforms, and synthesizes comprehensive, data-driven answers. Unlike simple chatbots, Dexter plans ahead, validates its progress, and iterates until it gathers the information needed to thoroughly answer your questions.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research and trading steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather financial data and manage portfolios
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements
- **Comprehensive Trading Integration**: Full Alpaca API support including orders, positions, account info, market data, watchlists, and portfolio history
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/dexter.git
cd dexter
```

2. Install dependencies with uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
# ALPACA_API_KEY=your-alpaca-key
# ALPACA_API_SECRET=your-alpaca-secret
# ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
```

### Usage

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
uv run dexter-agent
```

### Example Queries

Try asking Dexter questions like:
- "What was Apple's revenue growth over the last 4 quarters?"
- "Compare Microsoft and Google's operating margins for 2023"
- "Analyze Tesla's cash flow trends over the past year"
- "What is Amazon's debt-to-equity ratio based on recent financials?"

- "Show me my account activities for today"
- "Create a watchlist with AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA"
- "What's my portfolio value history for the last month?"

Dexter will automatically:
1. Break down your question into research tasks
2. Fetch the necessary financial data or execute trades
3. Perform calculations and analysis
4. Provide a comprehensive, data-rich answer

## Architecture

Dexter uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:

- **Planning Agent**: Analyzes queries and creates structured task lists
- **Action Agent**: Selects appropriate tools and executes research steps
- **Validation Agent**: Verifies task completion and data sufficiency
- **Answer Agent**: Synthesizes findings into comprehensive responses
