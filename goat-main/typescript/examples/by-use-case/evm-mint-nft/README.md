# Mint an NFT on EVM
## 🚀 Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to use GOAT to **mint an NFT on EVM** using [Crossmint](https://www.crossmint.com/). It also includes the ability to create a wallets for X/Twitter users and emails and drop NFTs into those wallets. This example uses **Ethereum Sepolia** but you can implement it with any other EVM network by changing the chain and RPC URL.

You can use this example with any other agent framework, chain, and wallet of your choice.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat.git && cd goat
```

2. Run the following commands from the `typescript` directory:
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

3. Go to the example directory:
```bash
cd examples/by-use-case/evm-mint-nft
```

4. Copy the `.env.template` and populate with your values:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `RPC_PROVIDER_URL`
- `CROSSMINT_API_KEY` - Use staging key for development, production key for mainnet

## Usage
1. Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm ts-node index.ts
```

2. Chat with the agent:
- Create a wallet for an X/Twitter user or email
- Mint an NFT to the wallet

3. To use the production key, set the `CROSSMINT_API_KEY` environment variable to your production key and change the chain to a mainnet chain.

## Using in production
In production, developers require advanced wallet setups that utilize [smart wallets](https://docs.goat-sdk.com/concepts/smart-wallets), which allow them to:
1. **Increase security** by setting programmable permissions (e.g. limiting fund amounts, restricting contract interactions, and defining required signatures)
2. **Maintain regulatory compliance** by ensuring agent wallets are non-custodial. This means that:
     - Launchpads, wallet providers, or agent platforms never have access to agents' wallets.
     - Agent platforms do not require money transmitter licenses.

### Agent Wallets
[Crossmint](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets) offers one of the most advanced solutions for agent developers and launchpads: [Agent Wallets](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets).
